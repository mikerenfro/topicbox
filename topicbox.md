The top-level site is on [Topicbox][topicbox].
There are two HPC-specific lists, "discuss-hpc" and "maintainers-hpc".
The system does not use passwords,
log-ins are via a verification code sent to your e-mail.
I don't recall how to join the lists,
my recollection is that anyone can participate in "discuss-hpc",
but "maintainers-hpc" is by invitation?
